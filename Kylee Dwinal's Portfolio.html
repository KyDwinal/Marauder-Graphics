	<p>My name is Kylee and I am a senior graphic design major at Millersville. Outside of class I am Co-Owner and Designer of Samsel and Dwinal Designs and do freelance photography. In reflection of my work I've completed at Millersville and in my own time, Marketing and Advertising is where I feel I will be able to contribute most in the world of design. Check out some of my work below!</p>
	
	<h2 style="color:purple; font-size:40px;">Where Have I Been?</h2>
	
	<h3 style=" font-size:30px;">1</h3>
	
	<p2>My interst for design started in high school where I took my first graphic design class. I fell in love with the various styles of design and the simplicity that design can have when passion is put into the work.</p2>
	
	<h4 style=" font-size:30px;">2</h4>
	
	<p3>At Millersville, I have taken a series of design courses to get to where I am today! They range from Typography to Visual Communications to Experience Design, and lastly, my Capstone Portfolio course. Merging my love for photography with design has given me an edge in classes making sure I pay attention to the smallest details.</p3>
	
	<h5 style=" font-size:30px;">3</h5>
	
	<p4>While designing the work I have created so far I notice that I am finding a love for modern and simplistic design. This style is something I am attracted to and incorporating it with the Marketing and Advertising industry is something of interest.</p4>
	
	<h6 style="color:purple; font-size:40px;">Design</h6>
	
	<p5>From the series of classes I have taken, to the right are some of my best design projects throughout my time at Millersville. While others may not consider these to be my best, I consider them as so because they display organization, hierarchy, proper design elements, and good use of textual composition. These designs were created in Typography 1, Visual Communications 2, Design for Social Equity, and Desktop Publishing.</p5>

	<p6>Photography has always been an interest of mine. I started in high school and continued freelancing in college taking pictures of friends, family, and Millersville or other university graduates. Here I display some of my favorite shoots I have done over the past few years. Thank you to those who chose me as your photographer!</p6>
